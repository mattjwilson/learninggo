This might be the most boring repo on GitHub as it's just me messing around with some golang for a bit and having fun.  I'm actually kind of sorry you found this and are still reading.  I'm sorry!  Yes there's going to be stuff that I do wrong, and yes it's not going to be the most secure code in the world, but guess what.  I'm learning. That's the way it goes.
